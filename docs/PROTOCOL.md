# Approval protocol v1

The wire formats shared by adapters (Go), the hub (Go) and the iOS app (Swift). Anything not written here is not
part of the protocol. Architecture and reasoning: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), section "Clearing house".

## Roles

| Role | Holds | Trusted for |
|---|---|---|
| **Adapter** (one per service: Warpgate, Mailpit, Paperless, …) | the service credential; an Ed25519 signing key; pinned users (user id + account fingerprint) | building the request record, verifying decisions, acting |
| **Hub** | nothing that can act: bearer tokens for transport, ciphertexts, metadata | relaying and storing. It can drop or delay; it cannot approve, forge, or read a record |
| **Device** (iPhone) | Secure Enclave keys | showing the record, getting Face ID / PIN, signing the decision |

Every security property below holds with a hostile hub and hostile transports.

## Encodings

- **b64**: base64url without padding (RFC 4648 §5), everywhere.
- **Times**: integer Unix seconds (UTC).
- **JSON**: UTF-8. Readers ignore unknown fields. Nothing is canonicalized: signatures cover the exact payload bytes
  carried in the envelope, and hashes are over those same bytes.
- **Fingerprint** of a public key: the first 8 bytes of SHA-256 over the key's raw encoding, as 4 groups of 4 lower-case
  hex digits: `3f2a-91c0-77de-0b14`.

## Keys

| Key | Algorithm | Public encoding | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| adapter signing | Ed25519 | 32 raw bytes | file on the adapter's host (0400) |
| device approve | ECDSA P-256 / SHA-256 | X9.63 uncompressed, 65 bytes | Secure Enclave, Face ID (current set) or app PIN |
| device deny | ECDSA P-256 / SHA-256 | X9.63 uncompressed, 65 bytes | Secure Enclave, device unlocked |
| device encryption | P-256 key agreement (HPKE) | X9.63 uncompressed, 65 bytes | Secure Enclave, after first unlock |

ECDSA signatures are the 64-byte raw `r || s` form (CryptoKit `rawRepresentation`). Ed25519 signatures are 64 bytes.

**Device id** = the fingerprint of the approve key without dashes (16 hex digits).

## Signed envelope

```json
{"alg": "ed25519" | "es256", "kid": "<signer id>", "payload": "<b64 bytes>", "sig": "<b64>"}
```

`sig` is over the decoded `payload` bytes. `kid` is the adapter id for `ed25519`, the device id for `es256`. A verifier
checks the signature with the key it has **pinned** for `kid` before parsing the payload, and then checks that the
payload names the same signer (`adapter` / `device_id`).

## Sealed box (adapter → device)

```json
{"suite": "hpke-p256-sha256-aes256gcm", "kid": "<device id>", "enc": "<b64 65 bytes>", "ct": "<b64>"}
```

RFC 9180 HPKE, mode base: DHKEM(P-256, HKDF-SHA256) `0x0010`, HKDF-SHA256 `0x0001`, AES-256-GCM `0x0002`
(CryptoKit `HPKE.Ciphersuite.P256_SHA256_AES_GCM_256`). `info` = the ASCII bytes `wga/v1/record`, `aad` = empty,
one message per context. The plaintext is the JSON of a **signed envelope** whose payload is a request record: sign,
then encrypt, so the hub sees neither the record nor the adapter's signature over it.

## Request record (adapter → device)

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "id": "<adapter-scoped request id>",
  "adapter": "warpgate",
  "kind": "ssh.ticket",
  "shape": "once" | "lease",
  "risk": "normal" | "elevated" | "high",
  "title": "helper wants RW on db-01",
  "requester": "helper",
  "on_behalf_of": {"principal": "slack:U0123", "display": "Kim", "attested_by": "chatbot@agent-host"},
  "facts": [
    {"label": "Host", "value": "db-01"},
    {"label": "Tier", "value": "RW", "level": "warn"},
    {"label": "Duration", "value": "2h"}
  ],
  "reason": "<requester's own words>",
  "lease": {"duration_s": 7200, "scope": "db-01-rw", "max_uses": 0},
  "created_at": 1790000000,
  "expires_at": 1790000900,
  "nonce": "<b64 16 random bytes>"
}
```

- `title` and `facts` are written by the adapter from the service's own state: they are the **authoritative**
  part and are shown first. `level` is `""`, `"warn"` or `"danger"`. The app renders any kind from these fields
  alone. It needs no kind-specific code.
- `reason` is the requester's claim. The app shows it after the facts, quoted and labelled as the requester's.
- `on_behalf_of` is optional: the human the requester says it acts for, and which component attested it. It is a
  claim by `attested_by`, not by the requester.
- `lease` is present only when `shape` = `lease`. `max_uses` 0 means unlimited within the duration.
- `risk` = `high` makes the app ask for a second deliberate gesture before signing an approval.
- `nonce` makes every record unique. It is echoed in the decision and is single-use at the adapter.

## Decision (device → adapter)

A signed envelope (`es256`, `kid` = device id) over:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "request_id": "<record id>",
  "adapter": "warpgate",
  "decision": "approve" | "deny",
  "record_hash": "<b64 SHA-256 of the record payload bytes>",
  "nonce": "<record nonce>",
  "device_id": "<device id>",
  "ts": 1790000123
}
```

- `approve` must be signed with the device's **approve** key. `deny` may be signed with the deny key or the
  approve key.
- The adapter acts only if all of these hold:
  - the device is pinned and not revoked, and the key matches the decision;
  - `adapter` is this adapter;
  - `record_hash` equals the hash of the record it sent;
  - the nonce is unused;
  - `|now - ts|` ≤ 300 s;
  - the record has not expired;
  - the service still shows the request pending and unchanged.

  Otherwise it rejects the decision and does nothing.

## Acknowledgement (adapter → device)

A signed envelope (`ed25519`, `kid` = adapter id) over:

```json
{"v": 1, "request_id": "…", "adapter": "warpgate", "outcome": "approved" | "denied" | "rejected" | "expired" | "failed",
 "detail": "…", "decision_hash": "<b64 SHA-256 of the decision payload bytes, or empty>", "ts": 1790000125}
```

The app shows the outcome only after verifying the adapter's signature. An unverified ack is shown as "unconfirmed".

`approved`, `denied` and `expired` are **final**: the hub stops offering the request. `rejected` (the decision did not
verify) and `failed` (the service call failed) are **notes**: the request stays pending, and the person may decide
again. That produces a fresh decision with a new `ts` and the same record nonce. A record's nonce is used up only when
the adapter acts on it.

## Device card

A signed envelope (`es256`, `kid` = device id, signed with the approve key: making it needs Face ID) over:

```json
{"v": 1, "device_id": "…", "name": "Vince's iPhone", "approve_key": "<b64>", "deny_key": "<b64>",
 "enc_key": "<b64>", "created_at": 1790000000}
```

A card says what a device's keys are. Which **user** a device belongs to is said only by that user's roster.

## Users and rosters

A user (`vince`, `kim`; 1–40 of `a-z 0-9 . _ -`) is the set of devices on the head of their **roster chain**. Each
roster is a signed envelope (`es256`, `kid` = id of the signing device) over:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "user": "vince",
  "seq": 2,
  "prev": "<b64 SHA-256 of roster seq-1's payload bytes; empty for seq 1>",
  "members": [ {"kind": "device", "card": <device card envelope>}, … ],
  "ts": 1790000000
}
```

A chain `[r1, r2, …, rn]` is valid only if all of these hold:
- **r1 (genesis):** `seq` 1, empty `prev`. It is signed by the approve key of a device that is a member of r1.
- **Each later rk:**
  - `seq` = k and `user` is unchanged;
  - `prev` = SHA-256 of r(k-1)'s payload bytes;
  - it is signed by the approve key of a device that is a member of **r(k-1)**, the previous roster. That device may
    be absent from rk: a device can remove itself.
- **Every roster:**
  - at least one member;
  - every card verifies (as in "Device card");
  - no device id appears twice.
- **Unknown member kinds** make the roster invalid. `recovery` (an offline key that may sign roster updates but never
  decisions) is reserved for a later version.

The **account fingerprint** pins a user. It is the first 16 bytes of SHA-256 over r1's payload bytes, as 8 groups of
4 hex digits: `3f2a-91c0-77de-0b14-5c2e-aa01-9d3b-71f0`. The phone that made r1 shows it, and so does the hub. An adapter
pins `(user, account fingerprint)` and accepts a chain only if the hash of its r1 matches.

Adding a device:
1. The new device enrolls with a **join** code for the user. It is then pending: no adapter knows it.
2. An existing device of the user sees the join request: name and device fingerprint, which the person compares with
   the new phone.
3. On approval (Face ID), that device builds the next roster from **its own verified copy** of the chain, adds the
   new card, signs it, and posts it.

Removing a device is a next roster without it, signed on any current device.

Adapters re-fetch chains and verify them back to the pin. Compared with the head they last verified, a chain is
refused if any of these hold:
- its head has a lower `seq`;
- its head has the same `seq` but different bytes;
- its head has a higher `seq` but the chain does not contain that exact last-verified head. A device removed at vN
  still holds its key; it could sign an alternative vN' from v(N-1), where it was a member, and then vN+1'. Without
  this rule that would undo the removal.

Devices apply the same rules to their own user's chain. So the hub cannot add devices or roll back a removal an adapter has seen. It can still withhold a newer roster:
a removal takes effect at an adapter only once that adapter sees it.

An admin can also delete an account at the hub (management UI, break glass): for when none of its phones is left to
approve another. The next enrollment of that user starts a new account with a new fingerprint, which adapters do not
trust until `wga-adapter trust add-user` is run again; the old account's trust does not carry over.

## Hub HTTP API (transport only)

Every route requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Adapter tokens and device tokens are different kinds and
reach different routes. Tokens are transport credentials: they stop LAN noise and abuse, not forgery.

| Route | Caller | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v1/adapter/requests` | adapter | `{id, kind, expires_at, boxes: {device_id: sealed}}`: publish a request |
| `GET /v1/adapter/decisions?wait=25` | adapter | long-poll: `[{request_id, device_id, decision: envelope}]` not yet taken |
| `POST /v1/adapter/acks` | adapter | `{request_id, ack: envelope}`: resolves the request at the hub |
| `GET /v1/adapter/rosters?user=<id>` | adapter | `{user, chain: [roster envelopes]}` |
| `POST /v1/enroll` | new device (one-time code instead of a token) | `{code, card, genesis?}` → `{device_id, token, user, status}`. `genesis` (r1, containing this card) is required for a `new` code and refused for a `join` code. `status` is `active` (in the head roster) or `pending` (join not approved yet). |
| `GET /v1/device/roster` | device | `{user, chain}` for the device's user |
| `POST /v1/device/roster` | device (current member) | `{roster: envelope}`: the next roster. The hub checks it extends the chain, appends it, and stops serving devices it removes |
| `POST /v1/device/leave` | device | `{roster?, delete_account?}`: the device goes away and the hub deletes its record. `roster` is the next roster, without this device, signed by it: it takes itself off the account first. `delete_account` is only for the account's last device (its keys are going, so nothing could sign for the account again): the hub deletes the account. Neither: the roster is unchanged and the device may come back with a join code. |
| `POST /v1/device/push` | device | `{token, environment}`: the device's APNs token (hex) and `production` or `development`; an empty token stops pushes. The hub pushes a fixed text, never request content: "Approval request" to the devices a request is sealed for, "New device" to an account's devices when another asks to join. |
| `GET /v1/device/joins` | device | `[{device_id, name, card, requested_at}]`: pending join requests for the device's user |
| `GET /v1/device/adapters` | device | `[{id, key, fingerprint}]`: adapter keys to pin (trust on first use, fingerprints shown) |
| `GET /v1/device/requests` | device | `[{id, adapter, kind, created_at, expires_at, box}]`: pending requests that have a box for this device |
| `POST /v1/device/decisions` | device | `{adapter, request_id, decision: envelope}` |
| `GET /v1/device/acks?since=<unix>` | device | `[{adapter, request_id, ack: envelope}]` |

The enrollment link the management UI shows as a QR code (and as text):

```
wga://enroll?hub=<url-encoded hub base URL>&code=<one-time code>&user=<user id>&mode=new|join
```

`mode=new` makes the first device of a new user, which creates and signs r1. `mode=join` adds a device to an existing
user, pending approval on one of that user's devices. The code expires after 10 minutes and works once. `user` and
`mode` in the link only tell the app what to do; the hub enforces the code's own user and mode.
