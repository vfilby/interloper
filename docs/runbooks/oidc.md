# Hub sign-in with OIDC (Authelia example)

The hub's management UI, and phone sign-in in the app, authenticate with OIDC. Any OIDC provider that can put a
username and groups in its tokens works; the examples below are for Authelia 4.39 at `https://sso.home.example`.
This page is everything needed on both sides.

What sign-in decides, and what it does not:
- **It decides** who may hand out enrollment codes and see what.
  - Members of `interpose_admins` see everything, register adapters and read the audit log.
  - Everyone else sees only their own account: they can create it (their first phone), add phones to it, and revoke
    their own phones at the hub.
- **It does not decide** which phones can approve. That is each user's roster, signed by their own phones
  (`docs/PROTOCOL.md`).
- **So a compromised OIDC account can start an enrollment, and nothing more.** The new phone still waits for
  approval on one of the user's existing phones, and adapters trust users by account fingerprint, not by what the hub
  or the OIDC provider says.

## 1. Groups

In the provider's user directory (for Authelia, its LDAP backend or file users), create these groups, then add people
to them:
- `interpose_users`: may sign in to the hub;
- `interpose_admins`: may sign in and is a hub admin.

## 2. Authelia

In your Authelia configuration, under `identity_providers.oidc.authorization_policies`:

```yaml
      interpose:
        default_policy: deny
        rules:
          - policy: two_factor
            subject:
              - 'group:interpose_users'
              - 'group:interpose_admins'
```

Under `identity_providers.oidc.claims_policies`. This puts the username and groups in the ID token, which Authelia
4.39 otherwise leaves out. The hub falls back to the userinfo endpoint if this is missing, but one round trip fewer is
better:

```yaml
    claims_policies:
      interpose:
        id_token: ['preferred_username', 'groups', 'name']
```

Under `identity_providers.oidc.clients`:

```yaml
      - client_id: interpose
        client_name: Interpose Hub
        client_secret: '{{ env "AUTHELIA_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_INTERPOSE" }}'
        consent_mode: implicit
        require_pkce: true
        pkce_challenge_method: S256
        token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_basic
        claims_policy: interpose
        redirect_uris:
          - https://interpose-hub.home.example/oidc/callback
        scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'groups']
        authorization_policy: interpose
```

Provide the client secret to Authelia as `AUTHELIA_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET_INTERPOSE` (hashed or plain, in the same form as
your other clients' secrets), and give the hub the plain secret in a file. Restart Authelia.

## 3. The hub

The management UI needs a stable https name: `interpose-hub.home.example` is assumed above, routed by your reverse
proxy to the hub's `-admin` listener. Do **not** put forward-auth in front of it as well: the hub signs people in
itself, and `/oidc/callback` must reach it.

```
interpose-hub \
  -api :8740 -url https://<hub API name>:8740 \
  -admin 0.0.0.0:8741 \
  -oidc-issuer https://sso.home.example \
  -oidc-client-id interpose \
  -oidc-secret-file /run/secrets/oidc-client-secret \
  -oidc-redirect https://interpose-hub.home.example/oidc/callback \
  -oidc-admin-group interpose_admins
```

- **Session cookies** are signed with `<state>/session.key`, made on first start. Delete it to sign everyone out.
- **Sessions** last 12 hours.
- **Without `-oidc-issuer`** the hub has no sign-in and refuses to start unless `-admin` is a loopback address
  (development only).

## 4. Phones

- In the app's Enroll screen, under **Sign in**, enter `https://interpose-hub.home.example`, then tap *Sign in to get a
  code*. The OIDC provider's sign-in (two-factor) opens in a private browser session.
- The hub sends the app back a code for you: a **new account** the first time, otherwise **another device**. Approve
  that device on one of your existing phones.
- Nothing is remembered between sign-ins.
- An admin can still hand out codes from the management UI (QR code, link, simulator command).

## Usernames

The hub user id is `preferred_username`, lower-cased, and must be 1–40 of `a-z 0-9 . _ -`. A username outside that
is refused at sign-in with a message saying why.
